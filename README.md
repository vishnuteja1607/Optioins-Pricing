# Options-Pricing
At look programs where Monte Carlo Simulation is used to for path generation of stock prices, whose movements is based on the Geometric
Brownian Motion (GBM). Later these values are used to calculate call option prices and the final payoff.

First we define what is an option and list it's characteristics. An example is also shown.

Later we introduce GBM, which consists of a drift term and a volatility term(Wierner process). The expected return and volatility of the 
stock prices is constant in this model.
